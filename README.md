# de-orbit-auditor
A code that will calculate whether a satellite will naturally de-orbit in the span of 5 years.

This code is made mainly by myself but since it is my first actual project i used Gemini AI to make a code skeleton which did not reveal any of the code that had to be written but showed me what to put where.

This code uses the gravity constant, mass, radius and the air at sea level to calculate the density, velocity and drag.
